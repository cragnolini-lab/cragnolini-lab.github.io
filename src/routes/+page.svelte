<br />

<p>
	Our work combines molecular modelling, statistical physics, and inference methods to understand the structure and dynamics of biomolecular complexes.
</p>

<p>
	A central question we are trying to answer is how the presence of spatial and temporal ensembles can be represented theoretically, and incorporated in the interpretation of experimental data.
</p>

<p>
	We harness structural biology data to confront our models to experiment, and use predictive deep learning model to inform our interpretation of this experimental data.
